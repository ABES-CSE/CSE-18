        <h2>Definition of Quantum Computing</h2>
        <p>A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical <br> phenomena in an essential way: it exploits superposed and entangled states,<br> and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, as features of its computation.<br> Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways<br> classically described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities<br> simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary<br> ("classical") computers operate according to deterministic rules.

             Any classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a (classical)<br> mechanical device such as a Turing machine, with only polynomial overhead in time. Quantum computers,<br> on the other hand are believed to require exponentially more resources to simulate classically.

    <span>It is widely believed that a scalable quantum computer<br> could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer.</span>
